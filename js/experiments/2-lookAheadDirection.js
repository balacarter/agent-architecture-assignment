/* Based on the information below use the lookAhead method that you made for the sensor object to choose a direction to take. Also be sure
 * that the agent keeps a loyalty to this path meaning it will not change until it can no longer continue in that direction.
 * currentNode: Node which agent is currently placed
 * sensor: This sensor contains the lookAhead method and will also hold a prefferedDirection which holds the previous direction the agent took
 * graphData: This is the environment shown on the screen
 *
 * To test your solution, write the necessary changes on the code below and then open the index.html file.
 * Run the program with Value Chasing Agent selected.
 *
 * Additional Practice
 * Have the method return other directions besides the most valuable(e.g 2nd highest, 3rd highest , 4th highest)
 * Make agent have differing levels of loyalty. In other words make it change direction based on different rules(e.g if different direction has a value that is 3 higher
 * than current direction)
 *
 * If length is 14 and width 19, with no obstacles and 1 agent is selected and placed at (18,13) the agent should move to the left one vertex if it is done correctly
