/* Using the knowledge of the program make your own movement type using the sensors, effector, and agent objects
 * If you feel that your agent requires more sensory data add it to the sensors object so that you can use it.
 * If you want the agent to do effect the environment (e.g break down obstacles) add it to the effector object
 * Should you change the environment in any way be sure to explain whether this change is stochastic or deterministic, fully observable or not, discrete
 * or continuous, benign or adversarial
 *
 * To test your solution, write the necessary changes on the code below and then open the index.html file.
 * Run the application selecting Student Made Agent as the agent type.
