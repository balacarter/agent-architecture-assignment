/* In the simpleAgent movement method you may notice there is a line at the end which updates a variable leftOverValue. Using this
 * make a method that will return a boolean which will stop the the running of the agents if the only value on the floor is found under
 * a simpleAgent that is no longer running
 * agents:array with all the agent objects being used
 * graphData: environment being acted upon
 * 
 * To test your solution, write the necessary changes on the code below and then open the index.html file.
 * Test this by selecting a simple Agent for movement type and making another be value sensing or higher. Wherever the simple Agent stops add the max amount of
 * value to the tile. If the other agent continues running and stops when only the tile under the simple agent has a value then your code is a success.
